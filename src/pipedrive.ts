Here's the tutorial for <a href="https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/adding-a-lead" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adding a lead</a>. If a lead contains custom fields, the fields' values will be included in the response in the same format as with the `Deals` endpoints. If a custom field's value hasn't been set for the lead, it won't appear in the response. Please note that leads do not have a separate set of custom fields, instead they inherit the custom fields' structure from deals. See an example given in the <a href="https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/updating-custom-field-value" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updating custom fields' values tutorial</a>.
